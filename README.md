# Attendance System 

## Setting up

1. Ensure you have `uv` installed on your system. If not download it from their official [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) 

2. Next, clone this repo locally, then open this repo and run the command `uv sync`. This will properly setup the `.venv` (Virtual Environment) folder on the current runtime that's used on this package, which is `3.10.17` 

3. If the virtual environment isn't activated, you can activate it on windows by running `./.venv/bin/activate`
